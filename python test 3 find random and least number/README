// Purpose //
This code generates random numbers and finds the maximum difference between n and a random number that is less than or equal to n. If there is no such number, it prints "None"

i.e.

input: 3 6 (3 and 6 with a space in between)
==> n=3 , m=6 (no. of integers generated)
==> 10 6 30 20 1 8
then "1" will be printed

// END //
